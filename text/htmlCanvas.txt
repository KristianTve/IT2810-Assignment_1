<p>Animation of canvas is based on redrawing individual frames, making it harder to keep exact time as in SVG. Had to experiment with where the objects ended up in a certain time due to difference in travel lengths in the animation.</p>
<p>In comparison with SVG, you have to clear the whole image and continously redraw all the figures/frames</p>
<p>Have to move a "cursor" to draw by drawing lines or arcs. Instead of SVG that has a better API with existing shapes like lines, circles or polygons where you just have to supply coordinates of the corners</p>
<p>By having complete control over every frame that is drawn, the animation can easily be paused by not requesting the next frame. This way the still image of where the animation left off is showed.</p>
<p>If the animations should move independently of each other in terms of time, canvas is a great choice.</p>
<p>Made the canvas interactive by changing color variables and then redrawing the frame to update the color, without jQuery (click to try)</p>
