<p>I have chosen to only implement CSS-Flexbox as it enabled more inter dynamic element widths without being too constrained.</p>
<p>Since I have implemented a row wise element style, using flexbox for each row containing multiple elements in only one dimension made sense</p>
<p>If I wanted to have divs with multiple rows and columns inside I would prefer to use grid, as it offers complete control over multi-element positioning within divs.</p>
